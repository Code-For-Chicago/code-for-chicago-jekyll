    <h1>Why join us?</h1>
    <div class="text">
      Code for Chicago operates like a pro-bono digital consultancy. In lieu of making decisions on behalf of the
      communities we serve, we operate shoulder-to-shoulder. When we start a new project we typically partner up with a
      local organization. This means we begin by identifying their needs, drafting a problem statement, and
      collaborating throughout the process. Since we aren't our users, this ensures we are effectively addressing the
      needs of the community and not operating from our own perspective as practitioners.

    <div class="text">
      Other than doing projects for a good cause, volunteers of various skill sets and levels join us to try out civic
      tech,
      network with like-minded people, and learn new skills.
