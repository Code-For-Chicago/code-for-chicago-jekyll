## The post URLs are already generated for us

Thanks to Jekyll, all posts are just generated with markup. This require very little coding-savvyness!

## All you need is a text edtior

VS Code works really well, plus there are some great extensions for markdown that helps with linting, syntax highlighting and such.

## This doesn't look good - yet

Go back and click the Cannabis post instead. It looks a lot better.
